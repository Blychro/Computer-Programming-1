# Computer-Programming-1
Work done in my Computer Programming 1 class

These are assignments and side projects that I created during my programming 1 course in Python.
Many of these assignments were created using graphics.py which I was not responsible for the creation of and do not take credit for.

Some files only work when downloaded together:
salessata.txt, SalesForce.py, SalesPerson.py, salesPersonTest.py, and salesPersonTest2.py
wordlist.txt is the word bank for hangman.py
wordlistgames.txt is the word bank for hangmanGames.py
wordlistpokemon.txt is the word bank for hangmanPokemon.py
grades.txt is the data used for weightedAverage.py
