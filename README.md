# Computer-Programming-1
Work done in my Computer Programming 1 class

These are assignments and side projects that I created during my programming 1 course in Python.
Many of these assignments were created using graphics.py which I was not responsible for the creation of and do not take credit for.

hangman.py, hangmanGames.py, and hangmanPokemon.py are all the same code just with different text file imports.

Some files only work when downloaded together:
salessata.txt, SalesForce.py, SalesPerson.py, salesPersonTest.py, and salesPersonTest2.py
wordlist.txt is the word bank for hangman.py
wordlistgames.txt is the word bank for hangmanGames.py
wordlistpokemon.txt is the word bank for hangmanPokemon.py
grades.txt is the data used for weightedAverage.py
